# Data Science Test

This is a repository to test and learn about data science techniques. 

The aim is to understand how techniques work so they can be used in further projects.

Techniques will include:
- Web Scrapping
- Data Visualisation
- Machine Learning
- Facial Recognition
- Modeling Data Trends
- Creating a GUI interface for user inputs and outputs

This is not an exhaustive list and will be added to as the techniques are used

### Web Scrapping

The web scrapping work will use the example url http://books.toscrape.com/.

The project will find links on the homepage and then extract descriptions of the books from the different pages, storing it in a dictionary for further testing later. This may include Natural Language Processing of the descriptions and classification of the books by description to the sub-categories of the website
